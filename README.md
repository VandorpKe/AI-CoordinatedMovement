# AI-CoordinatedMovement

## Introduction

I am a student from Howest and am currently studying DAE with a major in Game Development and below you will find my research on AI-Coordinated Movement. 

This will be a simple implementation on how you could add coordinated movement to your game. Of course there is more than one way to implement coordinated movement, but this will just be a simple implementation as the movement will happen on a flat surface and not a complicated surface with hills, etc.
